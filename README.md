Overview of my project :-
This FastAPI project is a task management system with full user authentication, session timeout, and CRUD operations on tasks. It uses:

âœ…Register (POST /auth/register)
  Stores user with hashed password
  Enforces unique username
  Returns a JWT token

âœ…Login (POST /auth/login)
   Verifies credentials
   Returns JWT access token (expires in 30 minutes)
   Token Auth

âœ…Uses OAuth2PasswordBearer
   get_current_user() extracts user from token
   Invalid/expired tokens return 401 Unauthorized

ðŸ”§ Tech Used:

FastAPI â€“ Web framework

MongoDB â€“ User storage

python-jose â€“ JWT handling

bcrypt â€“ Password hashing (via utility)
